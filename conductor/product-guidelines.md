# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Preservation of Existing Design:** The current visual identity of the Flutter application should be maintained without significant alterations.

## User Interface (UI) Principles
- **Minimalist Error Handling:** Errors and empty states should be communicated through brief messages or icons to ensure a non-disruptive user experience.
- **Distraction-Free Reading:** Prioritize a clean interface that highlights article summaries.

## Coding Standards
- **Explanatory Comments:** Code comments should focus on explaining the rationale ("why") and the logic ("how") behind complex or non-obvious sections of code.
- **Flutter Best Practices:** Adhere to established Flutter and Dart conventions for state management and UI structure.
- **Flask Patterns:** Follow standard Flask patterns for API routing and database interaction.

## Modernization & Security
- **Library Updates:** A key objective is to update outdated libraries to address security risks and leverage modern technology.
- **Branching Strategy:** All modernization work MUST be performed on a separate Git branch to ensure stability.
- **Zero Downtime:** Changes must be carefully tested and deployed to avoid any service interruption for existing users of the live application.
